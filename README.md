High School Labs, coded in Java


In this repository, you will find the labs and homework completed during my years attending Troy High School.
The majority of these labs are completed in BlueJ, which is an IDE that supports Java.

The main purpose of the majority of these labs was to build a solid foundation of code and logic. Not only
was I challenged to constantly introduce new concepts into our coding (i.e. polymorphism, dynamic data
structures, etc.), I was also challenged to think logically in different ways. For that reason, the majority
of these labs are logic problems (i.e. Palindromes, Numbers, etc.)

Through these labs, I obtained a solid grasp of class hierarchy, data structures, polymorphism, testing and
debugging, and object-oriented programming.

These labs should all be complete. However, some of the prompts may be missing. If that's the case, try to
use your imagination :D.
